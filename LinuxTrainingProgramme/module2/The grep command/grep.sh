# 1) Explore some other commands like -E, + and ?

# -E (Extended Regular Expression):

# The -E option is used in some commands to enable extended regular expressions. Extended regular expressions provide a more powerful and flexible way to search for patterns in text.

# For example, in grep, you can use -E to enable extended regular expressions:

# grep -E "pattern" file.txt

# + (One or More Occurrences):

# The + character is used in regular expressions to specify that the preceding character or group of characters should occur one or more times.
# For example, in regular expressions:
# a+ matches one or more "a" characters.
# [0-9]+ matches one or more digits.
# ? (Zero or One Occurrence):

# The ? character is used in regular expressions to specify that the preceding character or group of characters should occur zero or one time, meaning it's optional.
# For example, in regular expressions:
# colou?r matches "color" or "colour" as the "u" is optional.
# file(\.txt)? matches "file" or "file.txt" as the ".txt" part is optional.
