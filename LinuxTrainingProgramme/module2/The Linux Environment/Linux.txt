Environment Variables

How can you determine the current setting for the secondary command prompt on your system? How can you change the secondary command prompt from the default value to your username?

Answer: To find out the current setting for the secondary command prompt, you can run the following command:

echo $PS2

To change it from the default value to your username, use the following command:

export PS2="\u> "

How can you ensure that the mv command (used for renaming a file) always prompts for permission before overwriting an existing destination file?

Answer: You can achieve this by using command switches, which are additional arguments preceded by a hyphen sign (e.g., -v, -i). Each command has its own set of switches that serve specific purposes or alter their behavior based on the switch used.
For the mv command, you can use the -i switch to enable interactive operation. To make the mv command more interactive and always ask for permission, run the following command:

alias mv="mv -i"

From now on, whenever you use the mv command, it will prompt for permission before overwriting an existing file.
